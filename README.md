# Byrd Hero Challenge

Creating sections from Byrd drone landing page in React using only HTML, CSS and JS.

Each seperate section is its own feature branch. I completed both the Hero page and Contact Form page with responsive design to match the layouts provided. (All colors are exact copies of the layouts, but the Contact Form backgroudnd is white instead of the given color to help seperate it from the Hero section which shares the same background color).

## File Structure

Inside the src folder there are 4 main directories:

1. Assets - contains all images and svg
2. Components - contains App.js and any components that are reusable across sections along with styling
3. Fonts - contains all custom typography
4. Sections - contains a folder for each section with section specific components and styling

All styling files are stored in the same directory as their corresponding component. I used BEM class convention to make
